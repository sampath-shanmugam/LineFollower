LineFollower
============
This code allows you to create your own line following robot.

Basically, what a Line Follower does is it has sensors to detect a black line on a white background and follows the path of the line, without any pre-determined code. It can be extended to avoid obstacles and such as well. 

This code requires you use two DC motors and an LM293D motor driver IC (to control the motors) as well as an Arduino board coupled with two IR sensor/receiver arrays. We recommend you use a breadboard to make all the connections and once everything is in working order, you may solder them.
